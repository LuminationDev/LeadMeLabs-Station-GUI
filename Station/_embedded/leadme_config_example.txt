Below is an example of the config that the Station will automatically look for. This should be placed in the root folder
of an experience that has been added to the embedded folder.
The only variables that are required are:
    - name
    - exeName
    - isVr
The rest are optional and can be left as blank or not included at all.

The headerFolder describes the path from the root folder into a folder that contains the header.jpg for the experience.
In the example the subfolder would be cospaces and the path would be calculated as 'cospaces\\header.jpg'. If the file
is in a nested file structure the double slash '\\' is necessary due to escape characters ie.e cospaces\\images would be
cospaces\\images\\header.jpg.
